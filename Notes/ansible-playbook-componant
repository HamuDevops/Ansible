📝 Playbook
A YAML file that defines automation steps.

Contains one or more plays targeting specific host groups.

Example:

yaml
- name: Update web servers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
🎭 Play
A unit of execution in a playbook.

Maps hosts to tasks and runs them in order.

Example:

yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
🧩 Modules
Core components that perform actions (e.g., install, copy, start).

Used inside tasks.

Example:

yaml
- name: Install Nginx
  apt:
    name: nginx
    state: present
✅ Tasks
Individual steps in a play.

Use modules to perform operations.

Example:

yaml
- name: Start Nginx
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started
